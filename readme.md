# Sorting Algorithms Analysis
Sorting Algorithms Analysis is a program that implements the standard merge sort, quick sort, and insertion sort algorithms in Java. The program outputs run times into a text file that can be analyzed to determine the time complexities of the various sorting algorithms. The program uses milliseconds to calculate the execution time of sorting. Our execution time, T(n), can be manipulated by dividing it by n and/or n^2 and graphed to compare relationships.
